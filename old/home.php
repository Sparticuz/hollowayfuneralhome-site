<p>On March 17, 1987, Holloway Funeral Home of Oldsmar, Florida, became a reality for Arthur and Jeanette Holloway. Owning a funeral home had been a goal for Art from the time he worked as an ambulance attendant during his senior year in high school. Speaking of that year, Art humorously states: What seventeen year old boy wouldn't love to drive fast sounding a siren? Preparing for his goal as a funeral home owner and director, Art then took a part time position at North Funeral Home in Tarpon Springs. In order to have the needed knowledge and achieve the needed credentials, he attended full time and was graduated from The School of Mortuary Science at Miami-Dade College in 1969 Followed by a full time employment for another funeral home and marriage to Jeanette who share his dream.</p>

<p>After working several years in the industry and with support and encouragement from family and friends, Art and Jeanette ventured to open Holloway Funeral Home in Oldsmar,  - at first a "Mom and Pop" (and baby Amy) business in 1987. The Holloway's give special credit of their success to God for direction and wisdom and to extreme efforts of family and friends, and the encouragement of their community. After twenty one years, Holloway Funeral Home, independently owned and operated, employing ten hard working individuals, provides a vital service to people in time of special need.</p>
